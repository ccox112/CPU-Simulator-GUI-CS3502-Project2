## CPU-Simulator GUI
A grahical user interface application with these components: CPU Simulator, QR code and Barcode Generator.

For CS3502 Project 2: Most of the starter code is unchanged. The only changes were to the round robin algorithm, making the array sizes equal to the number of processes instead of just a flat ten. In addition, a random number generator was added for all algorithms to aid in testing for larger process sets, and buttons for the two new algorithms were added and given event handlers. To run, open the solution and run, then choose the algorithm you want to test and answer all prompts. If you want to test random  burst or arrival times, the generator assignment to the variables is set below the regular assignment, so just comment out the regular assignment and messagebox prompt.
